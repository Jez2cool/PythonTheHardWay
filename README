Frequently Asked Questions
What happened to the comments?
I've converted all of the answers found in the old comments into FAQs just like this on every excercise. The comments started being nothing but me checking people's homework rather than help with the exercises, so I felt rolling the important responses into well written FAQs was better for everyone.
Can I buy the PDF by itself?
No, I'm trying to simplify everything I make now so I can produce more books rather than manage a ton of sales. I'm now simply bundling the PDF and Videos together and setting the price so they are still a great value.
Can I email you to get help?
Sure. Email help@learncodethehardway.org and I'll try to help when I can. I'm usually very fast with my responses, but if I don't reply I may have just deleted your email on accident thinking it's spam. Email me again if that happens.
